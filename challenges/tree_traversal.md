# Tree Traversal

**🎯 Output all nodes in a tree.**

Collect all living beings from the following tree structure in a single list.

    :::python3
    tree3 = [
              ['Rose', 'banana tree'],
              [
                [
                  ['hammerhead shark', 'stingray'],
                  [
                    ['chimp', 'human'],
                     'rat'
                  ]
                ],
                ['bee', 'ant']
              ]
            ]

## Hints

* Draw the tree. In which order would you go through the beings?
* How can you check whether you are dealing with a string or a list?
* Is it basically possible to walk trees of any depth with the same program?
* Research *"Tree Traversal"*
