The Composite Pattern
=====================

Implement a monster consisting of multiple `Monster` objects that occupy multiple tiles in the dungeon
(e.g. a dragon or giant snake).
Use the `Composite Pattern <https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/composite>`__.

----

The State Pattern
=================

Implement a `GamePaused` class that has the same interface as the `DungeonGame`.
The UI should have a `state` attribute that is an instance of either class.

Add a pause key that changes the state from the running game to the paused state and back.

The Builder Pattern
===================

The `Builder Pattern <https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder>`__ is very common. We will probably find an example for the Builder pattern soon.
